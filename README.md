Weekly Report 1
What is the Project?
Our project is called the Algorithm Visualizer. It will be a tool used primarily in academic settings, students will be able to choose an algorithm from a list of three categories (sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and graphing algorithms). There will be at least one algorithm available for visualization in each algorithm category (bubble sort in the sorting category, linear search in the searching category, etc.) Once chosen, the user can either enter preset data or input their own custom data, this will allow the user to see how different data sets affect the algorithm’s operation. Each step of the algorithm will display to the screen in detail along with pseudocode of how the algorithm works in a panel on the left hand side. The user will be able to pause, play, or step through algorithm visualization as well. This tool will not only be useful to students who are just learning how different algorithms function,  professors will benefit from it as well as they can use it to demonstrate different algorithms in class and talk through it step by step. Our primary goal with this project is to make a learning tool that’ll help professors and students alike demonstrate/understand various algorithms more easily.

Progress
This project will be written using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. We’ve established our website for documents using a Github repository, the project will be accessible via that same repository once it’s complete. We have all necessary developer tools needed to code in JavaScript installed, and we’ve created a basic GUI as a starting point for the project ahead. 

(UPDATE 1/30/25: Github made public, Gantt Chart added)

Planning
Gantt Chart: Available in repository, https://github.com/Cara-A/Senior-Project-2026/blob/main/GanttChart.png



Website: The website we are using is Github, we plan to host the final project through Github Pages. The documentation is available through the README file of the repository, currently the repository is private because we’re still developing the project but once it’s finished it’ll be made public for anyone to access. The link is:  https://github.com/Cara-A/Senior-Project-2026.git 

Current Challenges: The primary challenge we’re facing right now is that JavaScript has a bit of a learning curve. We decided this project would be a good opportunity to learn another programming language to further expand our skillsets so we’re starting with little prior knowledge of JavaScript, and while it requires a lot of research, we are making progress. Github is a similar matter, we’re learning how to best utilize that as well as we’re not entirely familiar with Github Pages but research has been helping greatly In the next few weeks, we would like to continue to build the GUI and work on building the algorithms/graphics. Since the visualization component is directly tied to the algorithm’s function, we intend to work on both aspects in tandem.

Weekly Report 2:
What was accomplished last week?
Last week, a timeline was set forth on how we will tackle this project moving forward. A basic menu was also created as a starting point for the project’s UI. All necessary tools for programming in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML were installed and we began UI development.

 What problems were encountered?
One problem that occurred was, the process of getting a repository to be hosted through GitHub Pages was a little more complicated than previously anticipated. Upon further research, we realized we were unable to admin both members of the team because the account the repository is currently on is a personal account. Only organization accounts can allow users to give collaborators admin rights to access the settings and through that publish the repository to GitHub Pages, which is a bit of a situation because it means half our team is unable to access the project settings fully and help with the publishing process.

 If solved, what were their solutions?
After looking more deeply into the organization accounts on Github, we found that making an organization account and transferring the repository to that account was a viable option for being able to put the repository on GitHub Pages while making sure both of us have admin rights and can fully access all aspects of the project.

 How does our team progress align with our project Gantt chart?
 As seen in the Gantt Chart provided, this week (02/02 - 02/06) is within our designated period for UI/UX development. This phase will continue over the next two weeks, bleeding into our Architecture Setup phase and our Algorithm Implementation phase. We anticipate developing the architecture and algorithms themselves will go hand in hand with developing the UI since this is a very visual project, getting our menu started was a crucial first step and moving forward it will likely continue to adapt to new changes/features made to the project.


 What is the plan for this week?
Next week, our team plans to start the Architecture  Setup phase and start to move into algorithm implementation
